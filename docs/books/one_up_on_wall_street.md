# One Up On Wall Street — Key Concepts & Notes

---

## 1. Book at-a-glance
- **Author:** Peter Lynch (with John Rothchild)
- **Core idea:** Individual (retail) investors can beat Wall Street by using their everyday knowledge, doing straightforward research, and following simple, repeatable rules.
- **Tone:** Practical, story-driven, full of checklists and rules-of-thumb rather than formal finance theory.

## 2. Lynch’s investing philosophy — short version
1. **Look where others aren't looking.** Use your daily life (stores, products, services) to spot promising businesses before analysts discover them.
2. **Understand the company, not the market rumor.** Buy businesses you can explain in a sentence.
3. **Be patient and know when to sell.** Hold on to winners; sell when story changes, fundamentals deteriorate, or the stock becomes significantly overvalued for its growth.
4. **Categorize the business and apply category-specific rules.** (See Section 4 below.)
5. **Value common-sense metrics over flashy models.** P/E, growth, debt, cash, inventories, pension obligations, and hidden assets are what matter.

## 3. Important lessons from (bonds vs stocks)
- Lynch warns that corporate bonds are often callable (which removes downside protection when rates fall). If your aim is to profit from interest-rate declines, **Treasuries** (non-callable government bonds) are typically preferable to callable corporate bonds.
- More broadly: understand the terms of fixed-income instruments before using them as a hedge or safe alternative.

## 4. The six stock categories
Peter Lynch groups companies into six types — each requires a different approach and different expectations.

### 1) Slow growers
- Characteristics: Very slow revenue/earnings growth (about GNP growth). Large, mature, often pay steady and generous dividends.
- What to expect: Price appreciation is modest; dividend yield is a major component of return. Good for conservative allocation.

### 2) Stalwarts
- Characteristics: Moderate growth (roughly ~10–12% historically per Lynch), large, strong businesses, defensive in recessions.
- What to do: They offer stability — buy for steady long-term ownership; if they run up 30–50% you might rebalance or trim.

### 3) Fast growers ("tenbaggers" potential)
- Characteristics: Small to mid-sized companies growing earnings aggressively (20–25%+). Often reinvest earnings rather than paying dividends.
- Risk/Reward: High potential upside but higher volatility and business risk. Lynch emphasized finding these early and holding through volatility.

### 4) Cyclicals
- Characteristics: Earnings and sales move with the business cycle (autos, airlines, commodity-related industries, certain manufacturers).
- Strategy: Time your purchases — buy when industry and cycle are depressed and sell when the up-cycle is in full swing. Beware poorly managed cyclicals that can be devastated in down cycles.

### 5) Turnarounds
- Characteristics: Companies with depressed results that may recover after restructuring, management changes, spin-offs, or asset sales.
- Types (from your notes):
    - Bail-out-dependent (government guarantees) — risky and often avoidable.
    - Unexpected recoveries ("who-would-have-thunk-it").
    - Small problems magnified by sentiment (a solvable issue driving the price down).
    - Good company inside a bankrupt entity (possible spin-off).
    - Restructuring to improve shareholder value (sell off non-core assets, cost cuts).
- Caveat: Avoid tragedies where outcomes are unmeasurable. Turnarounds require precise facts and conservative assumptions.

### 6) Asset plays
- Characteristics: Companies trading below the sum of their parts — valuable land, resources, investments, patents, or minority stakes that the market hasn’t fairly priced.
- What to look for: Footnotes, conservative book-value adjustments, hidden resources, tax-loss carryforwards, or undervalued subsidiaries.

## 5. Valuation heuristics & metrics (practical checks)
Lynch favored simple, understandable metrics. Below are the ones he stresses, mixed with your notes and pragmatic ways to apply them.

### Price / Earnings & PEG
- **P/E vs growth rule-of-thumb:** Lynch said a fairly priced company often has a P/E roughly equal to its growth rate (this idea popularized as the PEG rule — P/E ÷ growth ≈ 1). Treat this as a rule-of-thumb, not a precise law.
- **Practical step:** Compute trailing and forward P/E and compare to the expected growth rate (or 3–5 year CAGR). A PEG < 1 can indicate undervaluation; PEG > 1 suggests premium.

### Cash, debt & net cash per share
- **Net cash per share:** (Cash + short-term investments) − (long-term debt) , divided by shares outstanding. Compare this number to the share price — if net cash/share is a large fraction of price, stock may be cheap.
- **Debt factor:** Lynch looks at equity vs long-term debt mix. A roughly 75% equity / 25% debt split was cited as normal; higher equity % is safer. Distinguish **bank debt** (demandable, worst kind) vs **funded debt** (long-term bonds not callable if interest is paid).

### Cash flow
- **Price-to-cash-flow:** Compare price per share to cash flow per share. Lynch liked low ratios (historical ballpark: price:cash-flow ≈ 10:1 is common; lower is better). Prefer free cash flow (after maintenance capex).

### Inventories
- **Warning sign:** Inventories growing faster than sales can signal demand problems or obsolescence. Check gross margins and inventory turnover in MD&A.

### Pension obligations
- For turnaround candidates, check the pension plan status — the company remains legally responsible even in bankruptcy. Confirm pension assets vs vested liabilities.

### Book value & hidden assets
- Book value can under- or overstate true economic value. Look for **hidden assets**: undervalued real estate, resource reserves, shareholdings, patents, tax-loss carryforwards, or subsidiaries that could be spun off.

### Percent of sales (product concentration)
- If you like a company because of a single product, check what percent of overall sales that product represents. High concentration = more business risk if product fails.

### Pre-tax profit margin & cost leadership
- Compare sales / (pre-tax profit) or directly compare profit margin across peers. Higher long-term margins often indicate a durable competitive advantage.

## 6. Price vs Earnings charting
- Lynch illustrated that **price often moves ahead of earnings** and that价格/earnings relationships revert: when price is above earnings expectations, the risk of a decline rises until the P/E normalizes.
- Practical tip: plot trailing earnings per share on the same axis as price (or plot price / earnings multiple through time). Look for divergence: a sustained price-earnings decoupling requires corresponding earnings growth to justify the price.

## 7. How to use these ideas in a checklist (quick research workflow)
1. **Spot the idea with everyday observation.** Ask: why is this product/service selling now? What changed?
2. **Categorize the company.** Which of Peter Lynch’s six types fits? Apply that category’s rules.
3. **Run the quick financial checks:**
    - P/E and PEG. Is PEG ≈ 1 or lower?
    - Price-to-cash-flow. Aim for lower ratios.
    - Net cash per share and long-term debt ratio.
    - Inventories vs sales trend.
    - Pension fund (if relevant).
    - Hidden assets or asset value materially above market cap.
    - Percent of sales for the product that excites you.
4. **Understand management and story:** Are there one-off items, cyclical timing, or structural changes? Is the turnaround story measurable?
5. **Decide sizing & thesis:** How big will the position be if the thesis plays out? What are the downside risks? Set a sell rule (e.g., story broken, fundamentals deteriorate, or stock becomes richly valued).

## 8. Special considerations & caveats
- Lynch’s rules are **practical heuristics** — not guaranteed formulas. They are designed for common-sense research, not quantitative arbitrage.
- The PEG = 1 rule is helpful but can be misleading during macro shifts, near-zero interest rates, or for commodities-driven earnings. Always pair with qualitative business understanding.
- Turnarounds and cyclicals often require extra caution: know the industry cycle, capital needs, and covenant structure on debt.
