## Inflation, Money & Debt

### Inflation as a Political Phenomenon

Inflation is not merely economic — it is deeply political. It often happens because of money printing (expansion of the monetary base).

### Debt & Currency Erosion

Governments have historically used inflation as a way to reduce the real burden of external debt: inflate and repay with cheaper dollars.
Continuing to run high deficits as a percentage of GDP diminishes the value of the currency over time.

### Asset Allocation in Inflationary Regimes

* Prefer businesses with **pricing power** (able to pass through inflation) and **low capital expenditure** needs.
* Avoid capital-intensive businesses that require heavy maintenance and provide no real return.
* Businesses with **fast inventory turns** and **minimal receivables** are better inflation hedges.
* Avoid companies with large inventories or receivables; they perform poorly in inflation.
* Commodities without pricing power are especially risky.

## Valuation, Intrinsic Value & Capital Allocation

### Intrinsic Value Principles

Intrinsic value = the present value of all future net cash flows (to “eternity”).
The appropriate discount rate is the long-term government bond yield, possibly adjusted by 1–2%.

### Capital Allocation Options

Corporations can do five things with each dollar earned:

1. Reinvest in the business
2. Acquire other businesses or assets
3. Pay down debt
4. Pay dividends
5. Repurchase shares

### Comparative & Relative Performance

Business performance should always be compared to peers and evaluated through the quality of capital allocation decisions.

### Share Repurchases

Share buybacks make sense only when shares trade **below intrinsic value**, not simply to raise EPS.

## Risk, Leverage & Business Structure

### What Is Risk?

Risk is not volatility — it is the **probability of permanent loss of capital**.
Factors that increase risk include:

* High leverage or debt levels
* High capital requirements
* Commodity dependence without pricing power

### Successor Businesses

Having foresight is not enough; sometimes the best move is **to leave an industry entirely**.
Example: In the 1930s, visionary train operators saw airplanes coming — but the right move was not to buy airlines, it was to leave passenger transport altogether.

### Derivatives & Tail Risk

Buffett warned that **derivatives** could cause major systemic issues in the future, much like the stop-loss cascade that triggered 1987’s Black Monday.

## Market Conditions, Liquidity & Interest Rates

### Liquidity & Cash Preference

Buffett sold stocks and bonds in 1998 to raise cash at a time when most funds were fully invested — a signal that markets were overheated.

### Interest Rates & Asset Valuation

Interest rates are the gravitational force of the economic universe.

* Low rates push asset valuations higher.
* If rates normalize, valuations can fall.
* Zero or near-zero rates distort relative valuations.

When borrowing is cheap, wealthy and creditworthy investors amplify money creation via loans — injecting liquidity into the economy.


### Corporate Profits & GDP Share

It is unrealistic to expect corporate profits to remain far above 6% of GDP for long periods.
In 2013, profits exceeded 10% of GDP — likely unsustainable.

## Brand, Moats & “Share of Mind”

### Brand & Pricing Power

Strong brands hold **share of mind** — customers associate the brand with the product itself.
This confers pricing power and stability even in downturns.

### Commodities vs Differentiated Businesses

Commodities generally lack pricing flexibility and face price wars.
The lowest-cost producer usually survives.
Differentiated companies with strong moats and customer loyalty are far more resilient.

## Core Summary

* **Inflation:** Buy companies with pricing power and low capital needs.
* **Avoid:** Capital-intensive or commodity-based businesses.
* **Intrinsic Value:** Present value of all future cash flows discounted by long-term bond rates.
* **Risk:** Permanent capital loss, not volatility.
* **Interest Rates:** The key force influencing asset valuations.
* **Capital Allocation:** The true measure of management quality.
* **Brand Power:** The ultimate moat — “share of mind” equals pricing power.
