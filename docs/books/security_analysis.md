## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

- *Security Analysis* was first published in 1934 (and later revised) and remains the foundational text for value investing and rigorous fundamental analysis.
- The central goal is not to predict the future perfectly, but to estimate a **reasonable intrinsic value** and to buy securities with a **margin of safety** so that errors, volatility, or unforeseeable events do less damage.
- A key axiom: the difference between **intrinsic value** and the **market price** is what creates investment opportunities or dangers. 
- In the short run, markets may behave like voting machines; in the long run, they tend to weigh true value.
- Analytical rigor, skepticism of optimistic forecasts, and focus on safety are hallmarks of this method.

## 2. Key Concepts

### Intrinsic Value & Margin of Safety

- Intrinsic value is not a precise point but rather a **range or estimate** of what a security “ought to be worth” based on facts, adjusted judgments, and future projections. 
- The margin of safety is the buffer between intrinsic value and purchase price. It protects against estimation error, future surprises, or adverse developments. 
- Overconfidence in growth forecasts is dangerous; many of the most serious mistakes in investing come from excessive optimism about future trends.

### Capitalization Rate & Discounting

- Graham uses the concept of a **capitalization rate** (or “multiplier”) to relate normalized earnings (or dividends) to value. That is,  

  $$
  \text{Value} = \frac{\text{Normalized earnings}}{\text{Capitalization rate}}
  $$  

  or equivalently, earnings × (1 / cap rate).
- The capitalization rate is influenced by:  
  - The **quality, stability, and predictability** of the earnings stream  
  - The **long-term outlook** of the business or industry  
  - The **financial strength** (debt, balance sheet risk)  
  - The **management quality and record**  
  - The **dividend policy and payout consistency**
- Nominal interest rates (market rates) have two components:  
  1. A **real rate** reflecting supply of savings and demand for capital  
  2. An **inflation premium** (expected inflation)  
  - Credit or default risk also adds a further premium. (Your note on this is aligned with Graham’s views.)  
- Thus the cap rate is not static — changes in macro conditions, inflation expectations, interest rates, and risk perceptions affect it.

### Forecasting & Normalized Earnings

- Since any forecast is uncertain, Graham emphasizes using **“normalized earnings”** (i.e. smoothed over good and bad years) rather than simply extrapolating the last year’s number.
- Three conventional methods to forecast earnings:  
  1. Link aggregate market profits to total corporate profits (ex: S&P level)  
  2. Connect aggregate sales to GNP, then profits to sales  
  3. Use ROE logic:  
     $$
     \text{ROE} = (\text{Sales} / \text{Book Value}) \times (\text{Profit Margin})
     $$  
     and project these components forward  
- The payout ratio must also be estimated (how much of earnings will be distributed vs retained)  
- After forecasting normalized future earnings, apply the capitalization rate to estimate value

## 3. Adjustments & “Nonrecurring” Items

To get to clean, sustainable earnings, many adjustments are needed. Some of the usual items that should be stripped or adjusted:

### Past / prior years:

- Tax adjustments, forgiveness, or large nonrecurring tax items  
- Litigation losses, claims, settlement costs  
- Changes in accounting policies or estimates  
- Prior period restatements or corrections  

### In the current year:

- Gains/losses on the sale of fixed assets or investments (if non-core)  
- Discontinued operations or segments  
- Write-ups or write-downs of investments or foreign assets  
- Insurance gains or life insurance proceeds  
- Unusual or infrequent items:  
  - If both unusual *and* infrequent (extraordinary), these should appear below “net income” and shown net of tax  
  - If either unusual or infrequent (but not both), present them above net income, without tax effect, and disclose them  

For each adjustment, the related tax effect (or deferred tax consequences) must also be considered.

## 4. Types of Reserves & Balance Sheet Cleansing

Reserves are provisions or allowances created for various future contingencies. Graham classifies three types:

1. **Valuation accounts** – e.g. allowances on receivables, inventory reserves  
2. **Liabilities (reserves)** – uncertain future liabilities or contingencies  
3. **Reserves for future development** – e.g. R&D reserves, or provisions for product development losses  

When such reserves or provisions are adjusted (increased or decreased), the balance sheet and income statement both change:

- A reserve creation may reduce equity (or increase liabilities)  
- If reserves are released, equity or income may be boosted  
- Assets may be reduced or revalued  

A key insight: clean up these reserves to avoid “hidden cushions” that obscure the true financial position.

## 5. Inventory, Depreciation & LIFO/FIFO Adjustments

These topics are among the more technical but are extremely important in real-world accounting distortions:

- **Lower of cost or market** is the standard rule for inventory (i.e. value it at whichever is lower).  
- Depreciation methods — the idea is to systematically expense the cost minus salvage over useful life (or by rational, justified methods).  
- Under inflation, **inventory profits** can arise: older, cheaper inventory is sold at higher prices.  
- **LIFO vs FIFO**:  
  - When costs are rising, FIFO often shows **higher profit**, but leads to paying higher taxes.  
  - When costs decline, FIFO might understate profit (your note about “layer invasion”)  
- If a company uses LIFO, an **adjustment** must be made: the **LIFO reserve** is the difference between FIFO inventory and LIFO inventory.  
  - Add that reserve back (net of tax) to capital in denominator when calculating return ratios  
  - Ensure consistency of numerator (earnings) and denominator (capital) in ratio calculations  

Correcting for LIFO gives a truer picture of underlying earnings and capital.
