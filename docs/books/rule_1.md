# Rule #1 — Notes & Guide

---

## 1) Quick overview

*Rule #1* is a value-investing approach that teaches how to find "wonderful companies" (companies with durable competitive advantages — "moats"), calculate an intrinsic value called the **Sticker Price**, use technical tools to time buys/sells, and apply strict risk rules (margin of safety, liquidity, and discipline).

---

## 2) The five types of moats (short definitions)

1. **Brand** — customers prefer and will pay more for the product (trust, reputation, lifestyle).
2. **Secret** — legal or technical protection like patents, trade secrets, or proprietary processes.
3. **Toll** — control of a market/channel so the company can collect fees or otherwise restrict access.
4. **Switching** — product/service so embedded that changing is costly or inconvenient for customers.
5. **Price** — cost advantage that allows undercutting competitors while remaining profitable.

> When assessing companies, look for evidence that one or more of these moats are real, durable, and meaningful.

## 3) The "Big Five" — moat confirmation metrics

Phil Town uses five growth/return metrics ("Big Five") as a quick quantitative check for a moat. Ideally, these should each average **≥ 10% per year** over the past 10 years:

- **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** — how efficiently the company turns capital into returns.
- **Sales (revenue) growth rate** — revenue expansion over time.
- **Earnings per share (EPS) growth rate** — profit growth allocated to shareholders.
- **Book value per share (BVPS / Equity per share) growth rate** — balance-sheet growth.
- **Free cash flow (FCF) growth rate** — cash available after operating and capital expenses.

If one of these is weak or inconsistent, investigate further (see Cash Flow section below).

## 4) Sticker Price (intrinsic value) — step-by-step

**What you need:**

1. Current EPS (earnings per share).
2. An estimated (future) EPS growth rate (use the company's past **equity** growth rate as your best proxy when possible).
3. An estimated future PE (price-to-earnings) multiple for the target year.
4. A minimum acceptable annual rate of return (Phil Town uses **15%** as his target).

**Steps:**

1. Project **future EPS**: `future_EPS = current_EPS * (1 + g)^n` where `g` = estimated annual EPS growth, `n` = years (Rule #1 commonly projects 10 years).
2. Estimate **future market price**: `future_market_price = future_EPS * estimated_future_PE`
3. Convert future market price back to today for your required return (Rule One often uses calculators that determine the target **Sticker Price** so that the investment returns 15% per year over the period). Practically, the common shorthand in Rule #1 materials: `Sticker Price = future_EPS * future_PE` and then apply the required return / margin-of-safety rules from there.

**Extra guidance:**

- Use the company’s **equity (book value) growth** as a better guide for sustainable growth than short-term EPS swings.
- For **future PE**, a rule of thumb in the book is to use a number related to the expected growth (some readers use ~2× growth rate as a quick proxy) but always check historical PE ranges and sector norms.
- After computing the Sticker Price, Rule #1 commonly uses a **Margin of Safety (MOS)** — often expressed as buying at **50% of Sticker Price** (or another safe fraction) to protect against estimation error.

**Example (illustrative):**

```
current_EPS = $2.00
estimated_growth = 12% per year
n = 10 years
future_EPS = 2 * (1.12)^10 ≈ 6.21
estimated_future_PE = 15
sticker_price ≈ 6.21 * 15 = $93.15
margin_of_safety_buy_price (50%) = $46.58
```
