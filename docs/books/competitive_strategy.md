Chapter 1:

An industry is a group of firms producing products that are close substitutes to each other.
The free market return is the yield on long term government securities adjusted upward by the risk of capital loss.

Five competitive forces: 
•	Entry and exit
•	Threat of substitution 
•	Bargaining power of buyers
•	Bargaining power of suppliers
•	Rivalry

Barriers to entry:
•	Economies of scale: refer to decline in unit costs of a product as the absolute volume per period increases.
•	Product differentiation: means that established firms have brand identification and customer loyalties.
•	Capital requirements: the need to invest large financial resources in order to compete, particularly if the capital is required for risky or unrecoverable up-front advertising or R&D.
•	Switching costs: a barrier created by the presence of switching costs, that is a one-time costs facing the buyer of switching from one supplier’s product to another’s.
•	Access to distribution channels: a barrier can be created by the new entrant’s need to secure distribution for its product.
•	Government policy: Government can limit or even foreclose entry into industries with such controls as licensing requirements and limits on access to raw materials.


Substitutes limit the potential returns of an industry by placing a ceiling on the prices firms in the industry can profitably charge.

A group of buyers is powerful if:
•	The purchases are in large volumes relative to seller sales.
•	The product it purchases represent a significant fraction of the buyer’s costs.
•	The product is standard or undifferentiated.
•	The seller face switching cost.
•	The buyer earns low profits.
•	Buyers pose a credible threat of backward integration.
•	The product is unimportant to the quality of the buyer’s products.

A group of suppliers are powerful if:
•	It is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
•	It is not obliged to contend with other substitute products for sale.
•	The industry is not an important customer of the supplier group.
•	The supplier product is an important input to the buyer’s business.
•	The supplier group products are differentiated, or it has built up switching costs.
•	The supplier group poses a credible threat of forward integration.

LABOR must be recognized as a supplier with power.


Chapter 2:

Generic strategies: 
1)	overall cost leadership 
2)	differentiation 
3)	focus

1/ overall cost leadership: 
Achieving a low overall cost position often requires a high relative market share or other advantages, such as favorable access to raw materials.

3/ Focus: it is focusing on a particular buyer group, segment of the product line, or geographic market.
Achieves either differentiation of lower costs in serving the target or both.


In some industries, caught in the middle mean that smaller (focused or differentiated) firms and the largest (cost leadership) firms are the most profitable, and the medium sized firms are the least profitable; this implies a U-shaped relationship between profitability and market share.

A firm may achieve differentiation, yet this differentiation will usually sustain only so much of a price differential from competitors.


Chapter 3:

Four diagnostic components to a competitor analysis: future goals, current strategy, assumptions, and capabilities.

sustainable growth = (asset turnover) * (after tax return on sales) * (assets/debt) * (debt/equity) * (fraction of earnings retained)


Chapter 4:

market signal is any action by a competitor that provides a direct or indirect indication of its intentions, motives, goals, or internal situation. 

Types of market signals:
•	Prior announcements of moves: it is a formal communication made by a competitor that it wither will or will not take some action. An announcement does not necessarily ensure that an action will be taken.
•	Announcements of results or actions after the fact.
•	Public discussions of the industry by competitors.
•	Competitors discussions and explanations of their own moves.
•	Competitors tactics relative to what they could have done.
•	Manner in which strategic changes are initially implemented: the manner in which any strategic change is implemented can help differentiate between a competitor's desire to inflict a penalty and its desire to make a move in the best interests of the industry.
•	Divergence from past goals: is an indication of a potential major realignment in goals and assumptions.
•	Divergence from industry precedent (industry norms)
•	The cross-parry: When one form initiates a move in one area and a competitor responds in a different area with one that affects the initiating firm.
•	The fighting brand: A firm can introduce a brand to threaten another. for example, coca-cola introduced Mr. Pibb to threaten Dr. Pepeer.
•	Private antitrust suits.



Chapter 5:

Cooperative or nonthreatening moves:
•	Moves that improve the firm’s position and improve competitors’ position even if they do not match them.
•	Moves that improve the firm’s position and improve competitors’ positions only if a significant number match them.
•	Moves that improve the firm’s position because competitors will not match them.

Threatening moves: focus on predicting lags (delay) in retaliation to offensive moves.
Lags in retaliation: a firm want to make the move that gives it the most time before its competitors can effectively retaliate.

Defensive moves:
•	Discipline as a form of defense.
•	Denying a base: not allowing the competitor to reach their goal.

Industry instability is the likelihood of competitive warfare.


Chapter 6:

Framework for buyer selection and strategy:
•	Purchasing needs versus company capabilities
•	Growth potential
•	Structural position: 1/ intrinsic bargaining power 2/ propensity to exercise this bargaining power in demanding low prices.
•	Cost of servicing

Intrinsic bargaining power of buyers:
Criteria that identify buyers without much intrinsic bargaining power:
•	They purchase small quantities relative to the sales of sellers.
•	They lack qualifies alternative sources.
•	They face high shopping, transactions, or negotiating costs.
•	They lack a credible threat of backward integration.
•	They face high fixed costs of switching suppliers.

Buyers who are not sensitive to price:
•	The cost of the product is a small part of the cost of the buyer’s product cost and/or purchasing budget.
•	The penalty for product failure is high relative to its costs.
•	Effectiveness of the product can yield major savings or improvement in performance.
•	The buyer competes with a high-quality strategy to which the purchased product is perceived to contribute.
•	The buyer seeks a custom designed or a differentiated variety.
•	The buyer is very profitable and/or can readily pass on the cost of inputs.
•	The buyer is poorly informed about the product and/or does not purchase from well-defined specifications.
•	The motivation of the actual decision maker is not narrowly defined as the cost of inputs.


Chapter 7:


Dimensions of competitive strategy:
•	Specialization: in terms of width of its line, the target customer segments, and the geographic market.
•	Brand identification
•	Push vs pull: the degree to which it seeks to develop brand identification with the ultimate consumer directly versus the support of distribution channels in selling its product.
•	Channel selection
•	Product quality
•	Technology leadership: lead or follow and imitate.
•	Vertical integration
•	Cost position: low-cost
•	service
•	price policy
•	leverage
•	relationship with parent company
•	relationship to home and host government


The first step in structural analysis within industries is to characterize the strategies of all significant competitors along these dimensions. After mapping the strategic groups in and industry, the second step is to assess the height and composition of the mobility barriers protecting each group. The third step is to assess the relative bargaining power of each strategic group in the industry with its suppliers and buyers. The fourth step is to assess the relative position of each group vis-a-vis substitute products. The fifth step is to assess the patterned of market interdependence among the groups and their vulnerability to warfare initiated by other groups.


A strategic group is the group of firms in an industry following the same or a similar strategy along the strategic dimensions.
Firms within a strategic group tend to have a similar market shares and also to be affected by and respond similarly to external events or competitive moves in the industry.

The five competitive forces will not have equal impact on different strategic groups.
Entry barriers depend on the particular strategic group that the entrant seeks to join.
Entry barriers also provide barriers to shifting strategic position from one strategic group to another, which is called mobility barriers.
Because of mobility barriers, market share of some firms in a specific strategic group can be most stable then other groups.

The industry with a complicated map of strategic groups will tend to be more competitive as a whole than one with few groups.
Four factors determine how strongly the strategic groups will interact in competing for customers:
•	The market interdependence among groups, or the extent to which their customer targets overlap.
•	The product differentiation achieved by the groups: if divergent strategies lead to distinct and differing brand preference by customers, then rivalry among the groups will tend to be less.
•	The number of strategic groups and their relative size: the more numerous and equal in size (market share) of the groups, the higher the rivalry.
•	The strategic distance among groups, or the extent to which strategies diverge: the more different the higher the rivalry.

The industries in which the followers’ rates of return were higher appear generally to be 1/ those where economies of scale are either not great or absent 2/ and/or those that are highly segmented. The industries in which leaders’ rates of return are higher seem to be generally 1/ those with heavy advertising 2/ and/or research outlays and production economies of scale.

Low-cost position within the strategic group may well be crucial, but low-cost position overall is not necessarily important.

Chapter 8:

Basic concept in industry evolution:

An industry passes through a number of stages: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.


Evolutionary processes:

Industries evolve because some forces are in motion that create incentives or pressures for structural change, these can be called evolutionary processes.

1/ long run changes in growth: 
A force leading to structural change is a change in the long run industry growth rate. Industry growth is a key variable in determining the intensity of rivalry and it sets the pace of expansion required to maintains share.

5 external reasons why long run industry growth change:
I.	Demographics: demographic changes are one key determinant of the size of the buyer pool for a product and thereby the rate of growth in demand. Like age group, income level, education level, or geographic locations. Also, part of the effect is caused by income elasticity, which refers to the change in a buyers’ demand for a product as his income rises.
II.	Trends in needs: Demand for an industry’s product is affected by changes in the lifestyle, tastes, philosophies, and social conditions. 
III.	Change in the relative position of substitutes: Demand of a product is affected by the cost and quality of the substitute product.
IV.	Change in the position of complementary products: Demand of a product to the buyer depends on the cost, quality, and availability of complementary products or products used jointly with them.
V.	Penetration of the customer group: most high industry growth rates are the results of increasing penetration, or sales to new customers. Eventually, however, an industry must reach essentially complete penetration. Its growth rate is then determined by replacement demand. For durable goods, achieving penetration can lead to an abrupt drop in industry demand. The relation between the growth rate before penetration and after will be a function of how fast penetration has been reached and the average time before replacement.
VI.	Product change: non-external force, product innovation can allow to serve new needs.

2/ Changes in buyer segments served:
Serving or no longer serving buyer segments.

3/ Learning by buyers:
Buyers accumulate knowledge, thus there is a natural force reducing product differentiation over time.

4/ Reduction of uncertainty: 
Most new industries are initially characterized by uncertainty about like potential size of the market, optimal product configuration, and potential buyers. Over time uncertainties will reduce which might attract new entrants, especially larger and well-established firms.

5/ Diffusion of proprietary knowledge:
Product developed by specific firms tend to become less proprietary. 
Mobility barriers bult on proprietary knowledge tend to erode over time.

6/ Accumulation of experience:
Unit costs decline with experience.
The significance of the learning curve for industry competition is dependent upon whether firms with more experience can establish significant and sustainable leads over others.
The tendency for proprietary technology to diffuse works against the learning curve because you give away all the R&D for free to other firms.

7/ Expansion or contraction in scale:
Increasing scale tends to widen the set of available strategies in ways that often lead to increased economies of scale and capital requirements. Contraction of industry scale has the reverse effects.

8/ Changes in input costs and exchange rates:
The important classes of input costs subject to change are wage rates, material costs, cost of capital, communication costs, and transportation costs.
Exchange rate fluctuation can also have a profound effect on industry competition.

9/ Product innovation:
Product innovation can widen the market and promote industry growth. 
Product innovation can come from outside or inside the industry.

10/ Marketing innovation:
Can allow reaching new customers.

11/ Process innovation:
Innovation in manufacturing process or methods. Can make it more or less capital intensive, increase or decrease economies of scale, change the proportion of fixed costs, increase of decrease vertical integration and so on.

12/ structural change in adjacent industries:
Since the structure of suppliers’ and customers’ industries affects their bargaining power with an industry.

13/ Government policy change:
Regulations of key variables as entry into the industry, competitive practices, or profitability.

14/ Entry and exit:
Industry growth seems to be the most important signal to outsiders that there are future profits to be made, even though this can often be a poor assumption.



Part II: Generic Industry Environments
Chapter 9: competitive Strategy in Fragmented Industries:

A fragmented industry is an industry in which no firm has a significant market share and can strongly influence the industry outcome.
Usually, fragmented industries are populated by a large number of small and medium sized companies, many of them privately held.


What makes an industry fragmented? (Most of the points give an advantage to being a small firm over a big firm)

•	Low overall entry barriers
•	Absence of economies of scale or experience curve
•	high transportation costs: transportation costs balanced against economies of scale determine the radius of plant can economically service.
•	High inventory costs or erratic sales fluctuations
•	No advantages of size in dealing with buyers or suppliers
•	Diseconomies of scale in some important aspect
•	If maintaining a low overhead is crucial to success: this could favour the small firm
•	A highly diverse product line required customization
•	heavy creative content is required (there are exceptions)
•	close local control and supervision of operations is essential
•	personal service is the key to the business
•	a local image and local contacts often are keys to the business
•	Diverse market needs
•	high product differentiation, particularly if based on image
•	exit barriers: marginal firms will tend to stay in the industry and thereby hold back consolidation
•	local regulation
•	Government prohibition of concentration
•	newness: an industry can be fragmented because it is new, and no firm or firms have a significant market share


Overcoming fragmentation:

An industry can be fragmented because of only one of the factors listed in the previous section. If this fundamental block to consolidation can be somehow overcome, this often triggers a process by which the entire structure of the industry changes.


Common approaches to consolidation:

•	Create economies of scale or experience curve
•	Standardize diverse market needs
•	Neutralize of split off aspects most responsible for fragmentation
•	Make acquisitions for a critical mass
•	Recognize industry trends early: sometimes industries consolidate naturally as they mature


Industries that are stuck:
Could be stuck for number of reasons:
•	Existing firms lack resources or skills
•	Existing firms are myopic or complacent: emotionally tied to traditional industry practices that support the fragmentation
•	Lack of attention by outside firms

If a firm can spot an industry in which the fragmented structure does not reflect the underlying economics of competition, this can provide a most significant strategic opportunity.

Coping with fragmentation:

In many situations, industry fragmentation is indeed the result of underlying economics that cannot be overcome.
Fragmented industries are characterized by a weak bargaining position with suppliers and buyers.

Strategies to cope with fragmentation:
•	Tightly managed decentralization
•	Formula facilities: this strategy involve designing a standard facility
•	Increased value added: like providing more service
•	specialisation by product type of product segment
•	Specialisation by customer type
•	Specialisation by type of order
•	A focused geographic area
•	Bare bones/no frills: that is low overhead, low-skilled employees, tight cost control, and attention to detail
•	Backward integration


Potential strategic traps in fragmented industries:

•	Seeking dominance
•	Lack of strategic discipline
•	Over centralization: since in fragmented industries firms are subject to no economies of scale or even diseconomies
•	Assumption that competitors have the same overhead and objectives 
•	Overreactions to new products


Chapter 10: Competitive Strategy in Emerging Industries

Emerging industries are newly formed or re-formed industries.

The structural Environment:

Common structural characteristics:
•	Technological uncertainty: what process or design is most efficient or the best
•	Strategic uncertainty
•	High initial costs but steep cost reduction
•	Embryonic companies and spin-offs: the greatest proportion of newly formed companies to newly formed units of established firms that the industry will ever experience. Spin off are a common phenomenon in emerging industries.
•	First time buyers: all buyers are new
•	Short term horizon" bottlenecks and problems are dealt with  expediently rather than as a result of an analysis of future conditions.
•	Subsidy: may come from government and nongovernment sources, it can be awarded through tax incentives, subsidizing buyers, and so on. Subsidies often add a great degree of instability to an industry because it is made dependent on political decisions.


Early mobility barriers: in emerging industry, the configuration of mobility barriers is often different from that which will characterize the industry later in its development.


Problems constraining industry development:

limits or problems:
•	Inability to obtain raw materials and components
•	Period of rapid escalation of raw materials prices: supplier bargaining power
•	Absence of infrastructure
•	Absence of product or technological standardization: accentuates problems in the supply of raw materials or complementary products, and can impede cost improvements.
•	Perceived likelihood of obsolescence: buyers will wait for the pace of technological progress and cost reduction to slow down.
•	Customers confusion
•	Erratic product quality: even if caused by few firms, it can negatively affect the image and credibility of the entire industry.
•	Image and credibility with the financial community: ability of firms to secure low-cost financing and the ability of buyers to obtain credit is low.
•	Regulatory approval
•	High costs
•	Response of threatened entities: some entity is almost always threatened by an emerging industry, and they will fight back.


Early and Late Markets:

The assessment of which markets will open up early and which will come later.
Number of criteria in determining:
•	Nature of the benefit: performance or cost, usually in emerging industries performance is favoured due to uncertainty.
•	State of the art required to yield significant benefits
•	cost of product failure: customers with high cost product failure will be slower in adopting new products.
•	Introduction of switching costs
•	Support services: product require some support services by the customer, so it will be adopted first by buyers which have such resources.
•	Cost of obsolescence: different customers are satisfied by different generation of the product.
•	Asymmetric government, regulatory, or labor barriers: some industries are monitored more closely than others.
•	Resources to change
•	Perception of technological change
•	Personal risk to the decision maker


Strategic Choices:

Strategic choices:
•	Shaping industry structure
•	Externalities in industry development: firms depend on each other to make the industry image good. dilemma to benefit the industry or just your own firm.
•	Changing role of suppliers and channels
•	Shifting mobility barriers: early mobility barriers may erode quickly in an emerging industry, often to be replaced by different ones as industry grow.


Timing entry:
Early entry is appropriate:
•	Image and reputation are important to the buyer
•	Early entry can initiate the learning process in a business in which the learning curve is important, experience is difficult to imitate, and it will not be nullified by successive technological generations.
•	Customer loyalty will be great
•	Absolute cost advantages can be gained by early commitment to supplies of raw materials, distribution channels, and so on.

Early entry is risky:
•	Early competition and market segmentation are on a basis different to that which will be important later in industry development. firm build the wrong skills
•	Costs of opening up the market are great, including such things as customer education, regulatory approvals, and technological pioneering.
•	Early competition with small, newly started firms will be costly, but these firms will be replaced by more formidable competition later.
•	Technological change will make early investments obsolete and allow firms entering later to have an advantage by having the newest products and processes.



Chapter 11: The transition to industry maturity

Many industries pass from periods of rapid growth to the more modest growth of what is commonly called industry maturity.
In response to strategic breakthroughs, mature industries may regain thier rapid growth and thereby go through more than one transition to maturity.
Maturity is always a critical period for companies in an industry, during which fundamental changes often take place in companies competitive environment.


Industry Change during Transition:

Changes in industry competitive environment:
•	Slowing growth means more competition for market share
•	Firms in the industry increasingly are selling to experienced, repeated buyers: buyer shift from deciding whether to buy the product at all to making choices among brands.
•	Competition often shifts toward greater emphasis on cost and service
•	There is a topping-out problem in adding industry capacity and personnel: as the industry growth slows down, the rate of capacity addition must slow down or overcapacity will occur.
•	Manufacturing, marketing, distributing, selling,, and research methods are often undergoing change: due to increased competition for market share, technological maturity, and buyer sophistication.
•	New products and application are harder to come by
•	International competition increases
•	industry profits often fall during the transition period, sometimes temporarily and sometimes permanently
•	Dealers' margins fall, but their power increases


Some Strategic Implications of Transition:

Maturity may force companies to confront, often for the first time, the need to choose among the three generic strategies (Cost leadership, differentiate, focus); it becomes a matter of survival. 

Sophisticated cost analysis:
Cost analysis becomes important in maturity to rationalize the product mix and price correctly.:
- Rationalizing the product mix: removing unprofitable items from the line and to focus attention on items either that have some distinctive advantage or whose buyers are good buyers.
- Correct pricing: average cost pricing or pricing the line as a whole rather than individual items, may have been sufficient in the growth era (Average-cost pricing may have been desirable to develop the full product line and establish a market position), maturity often requires increased capability to measure costs on individual items and to price accordingly.

Process innovation and design for manufacture:
The relative importance for process innovations usually increases in maturity.

Increased scope of purchases:
Increasing purchases of existing customers may be more desirable than seeking new customers. It can be increased by supplying peripheral equipment and service, upgrading the product line, widening the line, and so on.
In a mature industry, winning new customers means battling for market share with competitors.

Buy cheap assets:
Assets can be acquired very cheaply as a result of the company distress that is caused by transition to maturity. A strategy to acquiring distressed companies or buying liquidated assets.

 Buyer selection:
Identifying good buyers and locking them in.

Different cost curves:
The firm that is not the overall coat leader in a mature market can sometimes find new cost curves which may actually make it a lower cost producer for certain types of buyers, product varieties, or order size. This is the focus strategy.

Competing internationally:
A firm may escape maturity by competing internationally where the industry is more favorably structured. This may only postpone maturity rather than deal with it.



Strategic Pitfalls in Transition:

Some strategic pitfalls:
•	A company's self-perceptions and its perception of the industry are inaccurate
•	Caught in the middle between the 3 main strategies (Cost leadership, differentiate, focus)
•	The cash trap - investments to build share in a mature market: cash should be invested in a business only with the expectation of being able to remove it later. Maturity of the industry works against increasing or maintaining margins long enough to recoup cash investments down the road, by making the present value of cash inflows justify the outflow. A pitfall is placing heavy attention on revenues instead of on profitability.
•	Giving up market share too easily in favor of short run profits
•	Resentment and irrational reaction to price competition: difficult for firms to accept the need for price competition after a period in which it has not been necessary.
•	Resentment and irrational reaction to changes in industry practices
•	Overemphasis on creative and new products rather then improving and aggressively selling existing one.
•	Clinging to higher quality as an excuse for not meeting aggressive pricing and marketing moves of competitors: quality differentials have a tendency to erode as an industry matures.
•	Overhanging excess capacity


Organizational Implications of Maturity:

Difficult problems for general management:
•	Scaled down expectation for financial performance.
•	More discipline from the organization.
•	Scaled-down expectations for advancement.
•	More attention on the human dimension.
•	Recentralization.



Chapter 12: Competitive Strategy in Declining Industries

Declining industries are those that have experienced an absolute decline in unit sales over a sustained period.

Structural Determinants of competition in decline:

Competitive pressure erodes profitability depends on some key conditions:

Conditions of demand:
Major influence on competition:
•	uncertainty: uncertainty perceived by competitors about whether demand will continue to decline.
•	Rate and pattern of decline: the more slowly decline is proceeding, the more it may be masked by short run factors. The rate of decline is partly a function of the pattern in which firms actually decide to withdraw capacity from the business.
•	Structure of remaining demand pockets (niche): the nature of the pockets of demand that remain plays a major role in determining profitability.
•	Causes of decline: Technological substitution (technological innovation or shifts in relative costs and quality), Demographics, shifts in needs

Exit barriers:
Exit barriers fundamental sources:
•	Durable and specialized assets: specialized assets diminished the liquidation value. Durable assets may have higher book value than liquidation value.
•	Fixed costs of exit: like employees settlements
•	Strategic exit barriers:
o	Interrelatedness: the business may be part of a total strategy involving a group of businesses.
o	Access to financial markets: exiting may reduce the confidence of the capital markets in the firm.
o	Vertical integration: exit might effect the entire vertical chain.
•	Information barriers: Businesses performing poorly can be hidden by the success of interrelated ones in a company.
•	Managerial or emotional barriers
•	Government and social barriers
•	Mechanism for asset disposition: if assets in a declining industry are disposed of within the industry and not then retired, it is even worse for subsequent competition than if the original owners of the firms stayed in business.


Strategic Alternatives in Decline:

Four basic approaches to competing in decline:
•	Leadership: Seek a leadership position in terms of market share
•	Niche: create or defend a strong position in a particular segment
•	Harvest: Manage a controlled disinvestment, taking advantage of strengths
•	Divest quickly: Liquidate the investment as early in the decline phase as possible


Leadership:
The firm aim to be the only firm or one of few firms remaining, once this position is attained the firm switches to a holding position or controller harvest strategy.
Aggressive investing is needed to take market shar and purchasing of competitors to reduce exit barriers.

Niche:
The objective of this strategy is to identify a segment of the declining industry that will not only maintain stable demand or decay slowly but also has structural characteristics allowing high returns. The firm invest in building its position in this segment.
Ultimately the firm may either switch toa harvest or divest strategy.

Harvest:
The firm seeks to optimize cash flow from the business. Ultimately the business is sold or liquidated.

Quick Divestment:
Maximize its net investment recovery from the business by selling it early in decline.


Pitfalls in decline:

•	Failure to recognize decline
•	A war of attrtion: warfare with competitiors having high exit barriers leads to disaster
•	Harvesting without clear strengths


Chapter 13: Competition in Global industries

Sources and Impediments to Global Competition:
Firms can participate in international activities through three basic mechanisms: licensing, export, and foreign direct investment.

Sources of global competitive advantage:
•	Comparative advantage: When a country or countries have a significant advantage in factor cost or factor quality used in producing a product, these countries will be the sites of production and exports will flow to the world.
•	Production economies of scale:  if there are economies of scale in production that extend beyond the size of major national markets, the firm can potentially achieve a cost advantage through centralized production.
•	Global experience: in technologies subject to significant cost declines due to proprietary experience, global experience can allow for faster learning.
•	Logistical economies of scale: if an international logistics system inherently involves fixed costs that can be spread by supplying many national markets.
•	Marketing economies of scale
•	Economies of scale in purchasing: as a result of bargaining power or lower suppliers cost due to purchases which go beyond what is needed to compete in just one market.
•	Product differentiation
•	Proprietary product technology: global economies can result from the ability to apply proprietary technology in several national markets.
•	Mobility of production: the production of a product or service is mobile. Fixed costs of creating and maintaining an organization and developing proprietary technology can be readily spread over operations in many national markets.


Impediments to global competition:
Economic impediments:
•	Transportation and storage costs
•	Differing product needs
•	Established distribution channels: hard to access distribution channels in foreign country.
•	Sales force: if the product requires a local manufacturer's direct sales force, the international competitor confronts a potential scale economy barrier.
•	Local repair
•	Sensitivity to lead time: time it takes to change or ship the product can effect industries that is sensitive to lead time.
•	Complex segmentation within geographic markets
•	Lack of world demand: the product is new or only fit the needs of an unusual customer group which only present in few national markets.

Managerial impediments:
•	Differing marketing tasks: marketing is different in each country
•	Intensive local services
•	Rapidly changing technology: rapidly changing technology requires frequent product and process redesign attuned to the local markets.

Institutional impediments:
•	Governmental impediments: most under the guise of protecting local firms or local employment.
•	Perceptual or resource impediments


Evolution to global industries:
Few industries begin as global industries, but they tend to evolve into them over time.

Environmental triggers to globalization:
•	Increased scale economies
•	Decreased transportation or storage costs
•	Rationalized or changed distribution channel
•	Changed factor costs: increases in the cost of labor, energy, and raw materials can shift the optimum production or distribution configuration.
•	Narrowed national economic and social circumstances: if the market in different countries become similar in terms of the economic and social circumstances.
•	Reduced government constraints


Strategic innovations stimulating globalization:

•	Product redefinition: redefine product to fit other markets
•	Identification of market segments: there may be segments of the market that are common to many countries and that are being poorly served in many of them.
•	Reduced costs of adaptations
•	Design changes: design changes leading to more standardized components.
•	Deintegration of production: sometimes there are some constraints on local production, so production can be in another country and assembly is done locally.
•	Elimination of constraints from resources or perception


Competition in global industries:
The following issues must be confronted in some way by global competitors:
•	Industrial policy and competitive behavior: the relationship between the government and competitors should be examined. Government can support some companies for various reasons, which could raise the exit barriers.
•	Relationship with host governments in major markets
•	Systemic competition: involves a coordinated worldwide pattern of market positions, facilities, and investments.
•	Difficulty in competitor analysis


Strategic alternatives in global industries:
Compete globally or find a niches in one or few markets.

The alternatives:
•	Broad line global competition: compete worldwide in the full product line.
•	Global focus: target a particular segment of the industry and compete worldwide.
•	National focus: compete in national market in a global industry.
•	Protected niche: compete in countries where governmental restraints exclude global competitors.


Trends affecting global competition:
•	Reduction in differences among countries
•	More aggressive industrial policy

Trends affecting global competition:
•	Reduction in differences among countries
•	More aggressive industrial policy
•	National recognition and protection of distinctive assets
•	Free flow of technology
•	Gradual emergence of new large scale markets
•	Non developed countries competition: industries most vulnerable to non developed countries with the lack of the following:
o	Rapidly changing technology that can be kept proprietary
o	Highly skilled labor
o	Sensitivity to lead time
o	Complex distribution and service
o	High consumer marketing content
o	Complex, technical selling task
