Chapter 1:

An industry is a group of firms producing products that are close substitutes to each other.
The free market return is the yield on long term government securities adjusted upward by the risk of capital loss.

Five competitive forces: 
•	Entry and exit
•	Threat of substitution 
•	Bargaining power of buyers
•	Bargaining power of suppliers
•	Rivalry

Barriers to entry:
•	Economies of scale: refer to decline in unit costs of a product as the absolute volume per period increases.
•	Product differentiation: means that established firms have brand identification and customer loyalties.
•	Capital requirements: the need to invest large financial resources in order to compete, particularly if the capital is required for risky or unrecoverable up-front advertising or R&D.
•	Switching costs: a barrier created by the presence of switching costs, that is a one-time costs facing the buyer of switching from one supplier’s product to another’s.
•	Access to distribution channels: a barrier can be created by the new entrant’s need to secure distribution for its product.
•	Government policy: Government can limit or even foreclose entry into industries with such controls as licensing requirements and limits on access to raw materials.


Substitutes limit the potential returns of an industry by placing a ceiling on the prices firms in the industry can profitably charge.

A group of buyers is powerful if:
•	The purchases are in large volumes relative to seller sales.
•	The product it purchases represent a significant fraction of the buyer’s costs.
•	The product is standard or undifferentiated.
•	The seller face switching cost.
•	The buyer earns low profits.
•	Buyers pose a credible threat of backward integration.
•	The product is unimportant to the quality of the buyer’s products.

A group of suppliers are powerful if:
•	It is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
•	It is not obliged to contend with other substitute products for sale.
•	The industry is not an important customer of the supplier group.
•	The supplier product is an important input to the buyer’s business.
•	The supplier group products are differentiated, or it has built up switching costs.
•	The supplier group poses a credible threat of forward integration.

LABOR must be recognized as a supplier with power.


Chapter 2:

Generic strategies: 
1)	overall cost leadership 
2)	differentiation 
3)	focus

1/ overall cost leadership: 
Achieving a low overall cost position often requires a high relative market share or other advantages, such as favorable access to raw materials.

3/ Focus: it is focusing on a particular buyer group, segment of the product line, or geographic market.
Achieves either differentiation of lower costs in serving the target or both.


In some industries, caught in the middle mean that smaller (focused or differentiated) firms and the largest (cost leadership) firms are the most profitable, and the medium sized firms are the least profitable; this implies a U-shaped relationship between profitability and market share.

A firm may achieve differentiation, yet this differentiation will usually sustain only so much of a price differential from competitors.


Chapter 3:

Four diagnostic components to a competitor analysis: future goals, current strategy, assumptions, and capabilities.

sustainable growth = (asset turnover) * (after tax return on sales) * (assets/debt) * (debt/equity) * (fraction of earnings retained)


Chapter 4:

market signal is any action by a competitor that provides a direct or indirect indication of its intentions, motives, goals, or internal situation. 

Types of market signals:
•	Prior announcements of moves: it is a formal communication made by a competitor that it wither will or will not take some action. An announcement does not necessarily ensure that an action will be taken.
•	Announcements of results or actions after the fact.
•	Public discussions of the industry by competitors.
•	Competitors discussions and explanations of their own moves.
•	Competitors tactics relative to what they could have done.
•	Manner in which strategic changes are initially implemented: the manner in which any strategic change is implemented can help differentiate between a competitor's desire to inflict a penalty and its desire to make a move in the best interests of the industry.
•	Divergence from past goals: is an indication of a potential major realignment in goals and assumptions.
•	Divergence from industry precedent (industry norms)
•	The cross-parry: When one form initiates a move in one area and a competitor responds in a different area with one that affects the initiating firm.
•	The fighting brand: A firm can introduce a brand to threaten another. for example, coca-cola introduced Mr. Pibb to threaten Dr. Pepeer.
•	Private antitrust suits.



Chapter 5:

Cooperative or nonthreatening moves:
•	Moves that improve the firm’s position and improve competitors’ position even if they do not match them.
•	Moves that improve the firm’s position and improve competitors’ positions only if a significant number match them.
•	Moves that improve the firm’s position because competitors will not match them.

Threatening moves: focus on predicting lags (delay) in retaliation to offensive moves.
Lags in retaliation: a firm want to make the move that gives it the most time before its competitors can effectively retaliate.

Defensive moves:
•	Discipline as a form of defense.
•	Denying a base: not allowing the competitor to reach their goal.

Industry instability is the likelihood of competitive warfare.


Chapter 6:

Framework for buyer selection and strategy:
•	Purchasing needs versus company capabilities
•	Growth potential
•	Structural position: 1/ intrinsic bargaining power 2/ propensity to exercise this bargaining power in demanding low prices.
•	Cost of servicing

Intrinsic bargaining power of buyers:
Criteria that identify buyers without much intrinsic bargaining power:
•	They purchase small quantities relative to the sales of sellers.
•	They lack qualifies alternative sources.
•	They face high shopping, transactions, or negotiating costs.
•	They lack a credible threat of backward integration.
•	They face high fixed costs of switching suppliers.

Buyers who are not sensitive to price:
•	The cost of the product is a small part of the cost of the buyer’s product cost and/or purchasing budget.
•	The penalty for product failure is high relative to its costs.
•	Effectiveness of the product can yield major savings or improvement in performance.
•	The buyer competes with a high-quality strategy to which the purchased product is perceived to contribute.
•	The buyer seeks a custom designed or a differentiated variety.
•	The buyer is very profitable and/or can readily pass on the cost of inputs.
•	The buyer is poorly informed about the product and/or does not purchase from well-defined specifications.
•	The motivation of the actual decision maker is not narrowly defined as the cost of inputs.


Chapter 7:


Dimensions of competitive strategy:
•	Specialization: in terms of width of its line, the target customer segments, and the geographic market.
•	Brand identification
•	Push vs pull: the degree to which it seeks to develop brand identification with the ultimate consumer directly versus the support of distribution channels in selling its product.
•	Channel selection
•	Product quality
•	Technology leadership: lead or follow and imitate.
•	Vertical integration
•	Cost position: low-cost
•	service
•	price policy
•	leverage
•	relationship with parent company
•	relationship to home and host government


The first step in structural analysis within industries is to characterize the strategies of all significant competitors along these dimensions. After mapping the strategic groups in and industry, the second step is to assess the height and composition of the mobility barriers protecting each group. The third step is to assess the relative bargaining power of each strategic group in the industry with its suppliers and buyers. The fourth step is to assess the relative position of each group vis-a-vis substitute products. The fifth step is to assess the patterned of market interdependence among the groups and their vulnerability to warfare initiated by other groups.


A strategic group is the group of firms in an industry following the same or a similar strategy along the strategic dimensions.
Firms within a strategic group tend to have a similar market shares and also to be affected by and respond similarly to external events or competitive moves in the industry.

The five competitive forces will not have equal impact on different strategic groups.
Entry barriers depend on the particular strategic group that the entrant seeks to join.
Entry barriers also provide barriers to shifting strategic position from one strategic group to another, which is called mobility barriers.
Because of mobility barriers, market share of some firms in a specific strategic group can be most stable then other groups.

The industry with a complicated map of strategic groups will tend to be more competitive as a whole than one with few groups.
Four factors determine how strongly the strategic groups will interact in competing for customers:
•	The market interdependence among groups, or the extent to which their customer targets overlap.
•	The product differentiation achieved by the groups: if divergent strategies lead to distinct and differing brand preference by customers, then rivalry among the groups will tend to be less.
•	The number of strategic groups and their relative size: the more numerous and equal in size (market share) of the groups, the higher the rivalry.
•	The strategic distance among groups, or the extent to which strategies diverge: the more different the higher the rivalry.

The industries in which the followers’ rates of return were higher appear generally to be 1/ those where economies of scale are either not great or absent 2/ and/or those that are highly segmented. The industries in which leaders’ rates of return are higher seem to be generally 1/ those with heavy advertising 2/ and/or research outlays and production economies of scale.

Low-cost position within the strategic group may well be crucial, but low-cost position overall is not necessarily important.
