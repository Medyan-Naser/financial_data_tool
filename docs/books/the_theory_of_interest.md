# The Theory of Interest
## Income, Capital, and Discounting

* **Income** is a flow; **capital** is the present value of expected future income flows.
* **Enjoyment income**: agreeable sensations from consumption.
* **Money income**: receipts sufficient to meet cost of living.
* **Capital value** = discounted expected income from future services. Past costs are irrelevant.
* **Interest** connects income and capital:

    ```
    Interest = Rate × Capital
    ```

* **Capital gains** are changes in value, not income.
* **Discounting** is fundamental: the value of a durable object depends on expected future services, not past expenditures.

## Time Preference and Impatience

* **Time preference**: preference for present consumption over future consumption.
* Influencing factors:

    * Current income and its time pattern
    * Risk and uncertainty
    * Composition of wants
    * Foresight, self-control, concern for others
    * Fashion and habits
* Pure rate of interest exists for risk-free loans; default risk increases required rate.

## The Two Approximations of Interest

### First Approximation (Certainty)

* **Impatience Principles**:

  1. Rate of preference depends on individual income.

     ```
     f_1 = F_1(c_1' + x_1', c_1'' + x_1'')
     ```

  2. Rates of time preference tend to equal market rate `i`:

     ```
     i = f_1 = f_2 = ...
     ```

* **Market Principles**:

  1. Market clearing: aggregate loans and borrowings equal:

     ```
     X_1' + X_2' + ... + X_n' = 0
     ```

  2. Present value balance of loans:

     ```
     X_1' + X_1''/(1+i) = 0
     ```

* Generalization to `m` years and `n` individuals:

  * `n(m-1)` impatience equations, `m` market clearing equations, `n` present value equations.
  * Different years may have different interest rates due to variations in total societal income.

### Second Approximation (Opportunity and Adjustment)

* **Variable income streams**: `y_1', y_1'', ...` replace fixed `c_1', c_1''`.

* Impatience and market principles hold similarly, with updated variables.

* **Investment Opportunity Principles**:

  * **Principle A**: Choice restricted to feasible income streams:

    ```
    φ_1(y_1', ..., y_1^m) = 0
    ```

  * **Principle B**: Chosen stream maximizes present value; marginal rate of return over cost `r` equals market interest `i`:

    ```
    i = r_1 = r_2 = ... = r_n
    ```

* Equations and unknowns can be balanced; zero or negative interest rates are theoretically possible.

### Third Approximation (Uncertainty)

* With uncertain income, additional variables make equations unsolvable.
* Risk introduces a **range of interest rates**:

    * Riskier assets → higher rates
    * Safer assets → lower rates

## Investment Opportunity and Marginal Returns

* Investors compare **present cost** vs **future income**.
* Eligible options: maximize present value.
* **Rate of return over cost** (internal rate):

  ```
  r = incremental future income / incremental cost
  ```

* Investments continue until marginal return equals market rate (law of diminishing returns).

## Market Equilibrium

* Market interest forms where aggregate saving = aggregate borrowing.
* Individual tangency between time preference curve and opportunity line determines lending or borrowing.
* Aggregate equilibrium:

  ```
  Σ loans_i = Σ borrowings_i
  ```

## Interest and Capital Valuation

* Price of a good = discounted value of expected future services (including negative services).
* Rate of interest affects value more for assets with long future service:

    * Durable assets → moderate sensitivity
    * Perishable goods → minimal effect
* Capital value emerges from human valuation of expected income.

## Real vs. Nominal Interest

* Nominal (`i`) vs real (`r`) interest:

  ```
  1 + i = (1 + r)(1 + π_e)
  ```

* Real interest = purchasing power; nominal = currency units.
* Inflation expectations must be included in nominal rates to preserve real returns.

## Loans, Banks, and Credit

* Personal loans: primarily determined by impatience.
* Business loans: shaped by investment opportunities.
* Public loans: smooth government income/outgo via bonds.
* Banks as intermediaries adjust short-term money rates; real rates driven by impatience and productivity.

## Business Cycles and Interest

* Boom → high optimism → borrowing ↑ → rates ↑
* Recession → savings ↑ → rates ↓
* Short-term fluctuations overlay long-run equilibrium.

## Discovery, Invention, and Capital

* New inventions initially **raise interest rates** by creating high-return investment opportunities.
* Capital revaluation occurs as old devices lose profitability.
* Interest rises during active development, falls after exploitation ceases.

## International Capital and Parity

* Interest differentials depend on:

    * Exchange rate expectations
    * Currency risk
    * Capital mobility
* Flows adjust until real yields equalize across countries, accounting for risk.

## Natural vs. Market Rates

* **Natural rate**: equilibrium real rate, consistent with stable prices.
* **Market rate**: actual rate influenced by monetary policy.
* Divergence explains inflation or deflation trends.

## Practical Determinants of Interest

1. **Time preference / impatience**
2. **Investment opportunity**
3. **Purchasing power changes / inflation**

* Stability arises from steady expectations and sufficient options for investment.
* Interest is the **price of exchanging present for future income**.

## Marginal Rate of Return and Choice

* Each investment chosen as long as:

  ```
  r_option ≥ i
  ```

* Successive options follow **law of diminishing returns**, determining optimal intensity of activity (e.g., farming, mining, forestry).

## Summary of Principles

* Capital value = discounted future income.
* Interest equilibrates **time preference** and **investment opportunity**.
* Market clearing ensures aggregate loans = borrowings.
* Rate of return over cost guides investment intensity.
* Real interest = nominal interest – expected inflation:

  ```
  r = i - π_e
  ```

* Economic, institutional, and psychological factors influence practical interest rates.
